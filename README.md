# SDLFramework
This is a basic SDL Framework written in c++. Made following the SDL Game Programming book.

I'm starting to learn something about game programming and i found this amazing book that teach how to build SDL/C++ Game Framework.
This is a test, i'll try to keep this uppdated as much as possible and, when I'll be more into it, I'll try to add some personalizations.

#Don't look at my ugly code
I'm still learning this kind of programming, code could be really ugly. Class programming overall! Just look at this like you look a 
six years old book full of ugly written words!
